## How to load information into data frames from other sources

### How to load a world map
In the following, we load a world map from geopandas to a dataframe:
```python
# Load the world.shp data 
world = geopandas.read_file(geopandas.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))
```

```
### How to load tables from the internet to a data frame
It's is possible to load tables from internet pages, e.g. from Wikipedia.
In many cases, there are several tables on the page, some of them not directly visible to the user, so you might have to adjust which one you actually need.
In the presented example, we load a table that holds countries and the official scripts used in it:
```python
Alphabet_URL = 'https://www.key-shortcut.com/en/writing-systems/world-map-of-alphabets-scripts'
alpha_df = pd.read_html(Alphabet_URL)[2] #on this page, this is the 2nd table
```

## How to extend or update data frames
### How to load add missing values to a data frame
In the case of the map provided by ``naturalearth_lowres'' (see ADD HERE), some language codes are missing. 
These can be added in the following way:
```python
world.loc[world['name'] == 'France', 'iso_a3'] = 'FRA'
world.loc[world['name'] == 'Norway', 'iso_a3'] = 'NOR' 
world.loc[world['name'] == 'Greenland', 'iso_a3'] = 'GL'
world.loc[world['name'] == 'Somaliland', 'iso_a3'] = 'SOM'
world.loc[world['name'] == 'N. Cyprus','iso_a3'] = 'NCY'
world.loc[world['name'] == 'Kosovo', 'iso_a3'] = 'RKS'
