## Getting Started
### What's Docker?
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public or private cloud.
Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

### What's DWD?
Germany's National Meteorological Service, the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), is responsible for meeting meteorological requirements arising from all areas of economy and society in Germany.[source](https://www.dwd.de/EN/aboutus/aboutus_node.html)
They make their data publically available.
We will use their data in this lecture.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this lecture you need
+ [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
+ [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
+ [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) 

The service of DWD, [wetterdienst](https://wetterdienst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), can be used by either installing it on your workstation or within a Docker container.
In this lecture we will do the latter, using the smaller of the two Docker image flavors "standard" (instead of "full")

```cmd
$ docker run -ti ghcr.io/earthobservations/wetterdienst-standard
```
To be able to read the data, one needs to import pandas and the library of wetterdienst

```cmd
import wetterdienst
from wetterdienst.provider.dwd.observation import DwdObservationRequest
import pandas as pd
´´´
### Send requests
Now one can send requests and get dataframes as feedback, e.g.
```cmd
request = DwdObservationRequest(parameter=["climate_summary"], resolution="daily",  start_date="1990-01-01",  end_date="2020-01-01",  tidy=True,  humanize=True,  si_units=True).filter_by_station_id(station_id=(1048, 4411))
´´´
request is a dataframe, the information contenr of which can be seen in the following way:

```
request.df
´´´
returns
```
    station_id                 from_date                   to_date  height  latitude  longitude                    name    state

:::
No info on temperature; played around with parameter="air_temperature"; but no results so far. https://wetterdienst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/explorer.html gives at least some overview which parameters (in combination with others) have a result at all. No examples or docu found to use air/soil temperature to e.g. show global warming
