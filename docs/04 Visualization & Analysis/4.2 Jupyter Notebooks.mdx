## Getting Started
### What's Jupyter Notebooks?
Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents.

Notebook documents are used for literate programming, a method of writing computer programs. Modular notebooks may connect to a variety of computational back ends, called "kernels". Notebook interfaces are widely used for statistics, data science, machine learning, and computer algebra. [source_notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface)

Jupyter Notebook can connect to many kernels to allow programming in different languages. A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of requests (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply.
By default Jupyter Notebook ships with the IPython kernel. As of the 2.3 release (October 2014), there are 49 Jupyter-compatible kernels for many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia and Haskell.

In this lecture, we will use the default Python kernel.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this lecture you need
+ [requirements for dataframes](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02) (we will use the same data set as well)
+ [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

### How to read Dataframes in jupyter
To get aquainted with jupyter, let's just repeat the first steps as described in [Dataframes-basics](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02)
First, import pandas, then read in the .csv file and look at the top 10 lines:

```jupyter
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# returns the first 5 rows
df.head(5)
```

![df.head(5)](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/assets/images/3.2_head_table-08841885797b1c98df38d5d55e17ec25.png)

Overall, all the methods used in [Dataframes-basics](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02) can be nicely displayed using jupyter. 
But you can do even more to present and visualize your data and certain results.
