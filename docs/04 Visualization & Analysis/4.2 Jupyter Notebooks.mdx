## Getting Started
### What's Jupyter Notebooks?
Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents.

Notebook documents are used for literate programming, a method of writing computer programs. Modular notebooks may connect to a variety of computational back ends, called "kernels". Notebook interfaces are widely used for statistics, data science, machine learning, and computer algebra. [source_notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface)

Jupyter Notebook can connect to many kernels to allow programming in different languages. A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of requests (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply.
By default Jupyter Notebook ships with the IPython kernel. As of the 2.3 release (October 2014), there are 49 Jupyter-compatible kernels for many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia and Haskell.
[source_jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter)


In this lecture, we will use the default Python kernel.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this lecture you need
+ [requirements for dataframes](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02) (we will use the same data set as well)
+ [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

### How to read Dataframes in jupyter
After having installed jupyter, you invoke it with 
```cmd
jupyter notebook
```
If it does not automatically open in your browser, look for the address in your terminal (it contains "localhost") and manually copy it into your browser.
You may also have to create a new (python kernel) file, if it does not open automatically.

To get aquainted with jupyter, let's just repeat the first steps as described in [Dataframes-basics](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02)
First, import pandas, then read in the .csv file and look at the top 5 lines:

```jupyter
import pandas as pd

vgs = pd.read_csv(''vgsales.csv')  #the general code is df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') 
# returns the first 5 rows
vgs.head(5)
```

![df.head(5)](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/assets/images/3.2_head_table-08841885797b1c98df38d5d55e17ec25.png)

Overall, all the methods used in [Dataframes-basics](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02) can be nicely displayed using jupyter. 
But you can do even more to present and visualize your data and certain results.

### How to visualize in jupyter
Now let's re-create the excercises presented in [Dataframes-basics](https://zesch.github.io/practical-data-science/docs/03/02) using graph visualizations.

2.) Select the 10 Publishers with the most unique games published
```python
vgs.groupby('Publisher')['Name'].nunique().nlargest(10)
```

Using this dataframe, we create a bar chart displaying the same information:
```jupyter
sn.barplot(x= df.groupby('Publisher')['Name'].nunique().nlargest(10).index, # Put the indices of the 10 largest companies on the x-axis
           y=df.groupby('Publisher')['Name'].nunique().nlargest(10))        # Put the number of sold games of the 10 largest companies on the y-axis
 #These parameters are optional
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (5,5)                                      # Set the figure size
plt.xticks(rotation=90)                                                     # Rotate the labels on the x-axis
plt.title('Number of unique games in 10 most frequent publishers',          # Set title
          fontsize=15, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Publishers')                                                    # Set x-axis label
plt.ylabel("Number of games")                                               # Set y-axis label
plt.show()
```

3.) Rank all Publishers by their total Global_Sales
```python
ranked = vgs.groupby('Publisher')['Global_Sales'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
