## Getting Started
### What's Jupyter Notebooks?
Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents.
Notebook documents are used for literate programming, a method of writing computer programs. Modular notebooks may connect to a variety of computational back ends, called "kernels". Notebook interfaces are widely used for statistics, data science, machine learning, and computer algebra.
Jupyter Notebook can connect to many kernels to allow programming in different languages. A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of requests (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply.
By default Jupyter Notebook ships with the IPython kernel. As of the 2.3 release[12][13] (October 2014), there are 49 Jupyter-compatible kernels for many programming languages, including Python, R, Julia and Haskell.

In this lecture, we will use the default Python kernel.
