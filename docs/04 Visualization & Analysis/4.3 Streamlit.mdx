## Getting Started
### What's Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
[source_streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

You may find many open-source apps written in streamlit such as e.g. the following NLP apps: [a demo of an spacy NLP pipeline](https://share.streamlit.io/ines/spacy-streamlit-demo/app.py) or [an analysis of the game of thrones characters](https://got-streamlit.herokuapp.com/).

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this lecture you need
+ [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) 
+ [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
+ [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html)
+ [regex](https://pypi.org/project/regex/)
+ [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/)
+ [google-transliteration-api](https://pypi.org/project/google-transliteration-api/)

Or just download the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MeDarina/TransliterateYourName/blob/main/requirements.txt) from the corresponding project and execute
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can install some extra transliteration libraries if you want to implement some more scripts:
+ [aksharamukha](https://pypi.org/project/aksharamukha/)
+ [transliterate](https://pypi.org/project/transliterate/)

## Step-by-step guide to our transliteration app
In this lecture, we will built an app that shows transliterations from latin to other scripts on a world map (showing the corresponding transliteration of the name at the place where the script is used).
The choice of scripts is based on the availability of the transliteration.

### How to start streamlit
Having installed streamlit, you need to write the corresponding python programme (which you can do in your favorite IDE or text editor).
We create the file "translitName.py" and start with importing streamlit and adding a title to the app:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title('Script your name')
```
Now we can invoke it with :

```cmd
streamlit run translitName.py
```
As your command line will tell you, you can now open your streamlit app in your browser at ``http://localhost:8502´´.

### How to load text in streamlit
Now we want to read in the user input:
```python
user_input = st.text_input("Put your name here in latin script")
```
