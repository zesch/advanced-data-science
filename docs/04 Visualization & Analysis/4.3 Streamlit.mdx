## Getting Started
### What's Streamlit?
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
[source_streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

You may find many open-source apps written in streamlit such as e.g. the following NLP apps: [a demo of an spacy NLP pipeline](https://share.streamlit.io/ines/spacy-streamlit-demo/app.py) or [an analysis of the game of thrones characters](https://got-streamlit.herokuapp.com/).

### Prerequisites
In this lecture, we will built an app that shows transliterations from latin to other scripts on a world map (showing the corresponding transliteration of the name at the place where the script is used).
The choice of scripts is based on the availability of the transliteration.

To follow along with this lecture you need
+ [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) 
+ [pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
+ [geopandas] (https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html)
+ [regex] (https://pypi.org/project/regex/)
+ [folium] (https://pypi.org/project/folium/)
+ [google-transliteration-api] (https://pypi.org/project/google-transliteration-api/)

You can install some extra transliteration libraries if you want to implement some more scripts:
+ [aksharamukha](https://pypi.org/project/aksharamukha/)
+ [transliterate] (https://pypi.org/project/transliterate/)

### How to start streamlit

After having installed streamlit, you invoke it with 
```cmd
streamlit run translitName.py
```
